            <h2>Field Hockey</h2>
            <p> 
              You might be asking, "What is field hockey?" Well, field hockey is an outdoor game 
              played by two opposing teams of 11 players, each who use sticks curved at the striking end to 
              hit a small, hard ball into their opponent's goal. 
            </p>
           <p>
             Here are the rules of the game:
             <li>Two Halves, 35 minutes each</li>
             <li>11 players per side, including the goalkeeper</li>
             <li>Two umpires on the field officiate the match. An additional umpire may sit at the scorer's table</li>
             <li>The ball must be passed or dribbled down the field with the flat side of the stick</li>
             <li>A goal is scored when an attacker strikes the ball into the goal from within the striking circle</li>
             <li>Players may not shield the ball using their body or stick. All players must have an equal chance to play the ball</li>
           </p>
