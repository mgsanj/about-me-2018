            <p> 
              When it comes to free time, I know us millenials never have that. But, the rare times I do, I enjoy 
              sketching using a ballpoint pen, doing calligraphy, and reading. I would say that calligraphy is my favorite hobby. 
              I just started realizing my passion towards calligraphy. 
              If you are wondering what calligraphy is, calligraphy is is a visual art related to writing. It is the design and 
              execution of lettering with a broad tip instrument, brush, or other writing instruments. Here is an example of the calligraphy/art
              taken from my bullet journal:
