        <p> 
          Hi my name is Sanjana and I am in 8th grade in California, USA. 
          I LOVE to dance, sing, and play field hockey. I do Bharatnatyum dance, I used to do Indian Classical singing, and I usually play forward and middle-field in field hockey.
          My favorite trends are ripped jeans, sweatshirts, and scrunchies. 
          My favorite hobbies are sketching, listening to music, and going to the mall with my friends (Don't worry, my mom won't let me spend any money).
          A fun fact about me is that I have a twin sister named Alisha and we are faternal twins (Fortunately, that means we don't look alike).
          A lot of people get us mixed even though we look nothing alike, and it gets kind of annoying, so warning to you, DONT MIX US UP!
          Another fun fact about me is that I traveled to MANY countries which include India, Mongolia, China, Russia, and more. 
          My favorite YouTube channels are James Charles, The Dolan Twins, Emma Chamberlain, and many others.
