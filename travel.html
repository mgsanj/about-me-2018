            <h2>Travel</h2>
            <p> 
              My family and I LOVE to travel. We have been everywhere from Russia to Mongolia to Japan. Usually when we go travelling,
              we like to take home souvenirs that remind us of the places we have visited. The souvenirs we usually buy are... magnets. 
              Yes, I know, it doesn't sound very interesting, but we actually have a total of ... 63 magnets! Yes, we are a magnet LOVING 
              family!

             One thing our family loves to do when we travel is, doing the most popular activity there. FOr example, in Mongolia, 
             horses are really special there due to their low necks and wild behaviors. In Mongolia, my dad, my sister, and me (my 
             mom is scared of horses) went on a 2-hour ride from the grasslands of Mongolia into the dense forest. Another example is, in 
             Japan, you can see many famous temples. We walked around these temples, admiring their art, and also ate LOTS OF FOOD.
